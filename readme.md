## RoadMap
Currently this project is in its 0.1 beta stage, the following stages are planned to develop:
1. Create a minimum workable product 
2. Refactor the code so it can be imported as a library, with some prefabs ready to be used
3. Create a workable project that can be downloaded and use directly **<-- current stage**
4. Add support on different camera switching method, and rails
5. Add LAN support to use a special device/mobile phone to do remote control on the applications
